There were no errors when I commented out the #include <iostream>.

When I commented out "using namespace std;" in svutil.h, I got an error where the type of the parameters were undeclared. 


QUESTIONS::

I do not understand why there were no errors without the #include <iostream> when there are inputs and outputs inside the svtest.cpp file.
